# Readable Project

This is the final project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course from the React Nanodegree Program. It's a content and comments web app. 

Users of the app are able to:

* Post contents to predefined categories.
* Comment on their posts and other user's posts.
* Vote on posts and comments.
